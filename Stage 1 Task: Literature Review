## Introduction
In modern microbiology, the ability to swiftly and accurately identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is paramount, particularly in the face of rising infections caused by resistant pathogens. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) integration emerges as a transformative approach in the fight against AMR. This literature review is on the application of WGS to predict AMR in gram- negative bacteria isolated from cancer patients with neutropenic fever—a group particularly vulnerable to severe infections. Through a comprehensive analysis of  a study done by Sheburne et al., (2019), we aim to highlight how the power of genomic technology can reshape our understanding and management of antimicrobial resistance, especially in clinical settings.
