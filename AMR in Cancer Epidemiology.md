**Antimicrobial Resistance in Cancer Epidemiology**

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), otherwise known as the “Silent Pandemic” is a significant global public health challenge. According to WHO data, there was an estimated 4·95 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019, and by 2050, this number is expected to increase to 10 million deaths per year (_Antimicrobial resistance_, 2023).

Infections form major complications for cancer patients, mainly because of their immunocompromised status. When the cancer is compounded with antibiotic resistance, there will obviously be higher mortality rates and healthcare costs. Infections caused by resistant bacteria are increasingly common in oncology wards.

In a study conducted on 200 cancer patients at a specialized hospital in Gondar, Ethiopia it was found that 27% (54/200) of blood samples exhibited bacterial growth (Worku et al, 2022). Their cross-sectional study found out that bloodstream infections were more prevalent among males (66.7%) and pediatric patients (44.2%), with pediatric patients being significantly more vulnerable to these infections compared to adults. These bacterial infections lead to prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and, most critically, higher mortality rates among cancer patients. In cases of hematological malignancies this risk of mortality is high because such patients are often treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Over the past few decades, the epidemiology of bacteremia(bacteria in the bloodstream) in cancer patients has undergone notable changes. The paper done by Montassier et al., (2013) shows that historically, Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant pathogens responsible for bloodstream infections in Cancer patients. As highlighted in the paper, common Gram-negative bacteria implicated in such infections included _Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae_, and _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. These pathogens were mostly originating from the gastrointestinal tract infections which mostly affects cancer patients because of mucositis and neutropenia(Gustinetti, & Mikulska, 2016).

With many doctors now using indwelling medical devices like central venous catheters and broad-spectrum antibitiocs to treat these infections, Gram-positive bacteria are now taking over, mostly because the devices make a direct route for them to enter the bloodstream, and also because the antibiotics disrupt their normal flora.

Common examples of Gram-positive bacteria that are now frequently implicated in cancer patients include:

* _Staphylococcus aureus, e.g methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) which can form biofilms
* Coagulase-negative _Staphylococci (such as_ Staphylococcus epidermidis_)

* _Enterococcus species__ such as _vancomycin-resistant enterococci_ (VRE)

The evolution of AMR requires clinicians to continuously be upto date on the resistance trends in their regions. One of the strategies clinicians can use to combat resistance is implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs. Antimicrobial ttreatment should be given to Cancer patients  at the optimal dose and duration to minimize resistance(Nanayakkara, 2021). Also, innovative treatments like bacteriophages will come in very handy in severe cases.
